<!--Assignment 6: Transformations-->

Didn't have enough time to do live host

Points Attempted:

1r. Working.
2r. This works but controls seem a little weird, would recommend moving the mouse very slowly to see effect or the cube will move too far.
3r. This works but controls seem weird, will sometimes keep scaling the wrong way if switching between scales for one or two button presses, then resume correct scaling. Mapped to the arrow keys because I don't have a scroll wheel.
4r. This works but requires another mouse click to rotate the opposite direction, cannot switch rotation directions without clicking again as of now.

1e. Working, mapped to keys "i" and "k" since I can't use the scroll wheel.
2e. Working, mapped to keys "j" and "l" for same reason.
5e. This works but is a little wonky. Rotation will slowly speed up then return to normal after set interval, didn't see anything saying this isn't allowed.
6e. This is working.
7e. Should be working.
8e. This works, button does not change back to normal, did not see anything on this not being allowed.

Notes to Grader:

Submitting this assignment late.
Some of these transforms (specifically the mouse movement ones) act strangely when combined, would recommend reloading the page after each test to see full effects.
